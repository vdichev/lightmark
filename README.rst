LightMark
=========

LightMark aims to be a converter from lightweight markup languages (reStructuredText, AsciiDoc, Markdown) to a wide range of output formats. It is a project very similar to Pandoc_, but written in Scala. LightMark will likely initially target formats which are not supported by Pandoc (DITA, presentations, CVs, etc.).

Currently only the reStructuredText to HTML conversion works.
